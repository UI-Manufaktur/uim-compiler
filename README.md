# Base Library ðŸ“š uim-compiler

A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language).
 The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a low-level programming language (such as assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.
 
 On the opposite side is the interpreter, which is also used for the direct execution of program instructions written in one of the many high-level programming languages.
   The interpreter converts the high-level program into an intermediate language, which it then executes, or it could parse the high-level source code and then execute the commands directly, which is line-by-line or statement-by-statement.

 The basis for both approaches should be created in this library.
